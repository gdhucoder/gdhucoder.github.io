Probabilistic models and probabilistic programs A probabilistic model is a formal representation of a probability distribution over possible worlds.
The goal of probabilistic inference algorithms is to answer queries efficiently.
KEY DEFINITIONS Possible worlds—All states you consider possible Probability distribution—An assignment of a probability between 0 and 1 to each possible world, such that all of the probabilities add up to 1
Probabilistic model—A formal representation of a probability distribution over possible worlds Evidence—Knowledge that you have about a specific situation Prior probability distribution—The probability distribution before seeing any evidence Conditioning on the evidence—The process of applying evidence to a probability distribution Posterior probability distribution—The probability distribution after seeing the evidence; the result of conditioning Normalizing—The process of proportionally adjusting a set of numbers so they add up to 1</description>
